I share ressources I find useful for those interested in econometrics and machine learning and their application in economics.

### [Cross-Section Econometrics](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2017-webcasts)

### [Machine Learning and Big Data](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2023-webcasts) 

### [Mostly Harmless Econometrics](https://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) 

### [The Effect](https://theeffectbook.net/index.html)
This a very good introduction to Research Design and Causality by [Nick Huntington-Klein](https://nickchk.com/). He also provided animated plots on these methods [here](https://nickchk.com/causalgraphs.html).

### [Causal Inference for The Brave and True](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html)  

### [Reinforcement learning](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/)  

### [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn)
You will find a good introduction to NLP and RL.

### [Pytorch Forecasting](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
