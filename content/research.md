### Misspecified Asset Pricing Models Comparison Using Many Characteristic-sorted and Micro Portfolios

<div style="text-align: justify"> This paper estimates and compares nine unconditional and conditional asset pricing models with more than 3000 test assets that combine the well-known characteristic-sorted portfolios with micro portfolios. Micro portfolios are formed using financial characteristics but contain few stocks (5 to 10 stocks). Consequently, they are analogous to individual stocks, offer significant return spread, and improve the lack of discriminatory power of the characteristics-sorted portfolios. Among the models, four are macroeconomic or theoretical, exemplified by the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Model, while five are anomaly-driven, such as the Five-Factor Model of Fama and French. We use a regularized version of the renowned Hansen-Jagannathan distance to account for many test assets. This extension is equivalent to allowing for the presence of pricing errors for the true SDF, measurement errors, and market frictions.  </div>


### Hansen-Jagannathan distance with many assets

<div style="text-align: justify"> This paper examines the evaluation of asset pricing models with many test assets. We implement two interpretable regularization schemes to extend the Hansen-Jagannathan distance in a framework of a data-rich environment. These regularizations are relaxation of the Fundamental Equation of Asset Pricing and therefore take into account the global misspecified nature of models in finance. We use them to provide asymptotic distribution of Stochastic Discount Factor's parameters and implement comparison tests of asset pricing models.   </div>
